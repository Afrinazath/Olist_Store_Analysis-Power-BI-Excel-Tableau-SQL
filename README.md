## INTRODUCTION
  Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small businesses to larger marketplaces. 

  The Olist Data Store is designed to help businesses make more informed decisions about their products and marketing strategies. 

  By analyzing customer data from across the platform, the data store can provide valuable insights into consumer preferences and buying habits.

  In this project, we have analyzed an Olist Store dataset, that provides a centralized location for managing and analyzing various aspects of an online business, such as sales, customer behavior, and inventory for Business   growth.

  They can also integrate with various platforms such as email marketing, payment gateways, and shipping providers to provide a holistic view of the ecommerce operations.

  We get this dataset from Excelr Team. We have an e-commerce Olist dataset  with 9 csv files.
